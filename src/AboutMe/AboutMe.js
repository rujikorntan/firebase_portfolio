          Hello, my name is Rujikorn Yoocharoensub and my nickname is Tan.       
          This year I am 21 years old. Now, I am studying in the 3rd year of the faculty of computer engineering, 
          King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang(KMITL) and
          interested in web developer and Android developer. <br /><br />
          
          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            At this moment, I am looking for an internship for summer (June - July) although I donâ€™t have 
          any experience for real work I believe that my education and my effort will make me work 
          assignments successfully.
        </p>
