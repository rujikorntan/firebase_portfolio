      Hello, my name is Rujikorn Yoocharoensub and my nickname is Tan.       
      This year I am 21 years old. Now, I am studying in the 3rd year of the faculty of computer engineering, 
      King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang(KMITL) and
       interested in web developer and Android developer. <br /><br />
      
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        At this moment, I am looking for an internship for summer (June - July) although I don’t have 
      any experience for real work I believe that my education and my effort will make me work 
      assignments successfully.
